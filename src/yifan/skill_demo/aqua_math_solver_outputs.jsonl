First, I will use trigonometry to find the distances from the car to the tower at both angles (45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0). Since the height of the tower is constant, I can set up equations using tan(\u03b8) = opposite / adjacent. Then, I will calculate the distance covered by the car in 10 minutes (the time it took for the angle to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0). After that, I will find the remaining distance to the base of the tower (from the position at 60\u00b0) and use the car\u2019s uniform speed to calculate how much more time it will take to cover that distance.\n\nAction: plan[steps]\nObservation:\n1. Let the height of the tower be h.\n2. At 45\u00b0, tan(45\u00b0) = h / x\u2081 \u2192 x\u2081 = h (since tan(45\u00b0) = 1).\n3. At 60\u00b0, tan(60\u00b0) = h / x\u2082 \u2192 x\u2082 = h / \u221a3 (since tan(60\u00b0) = \u221a3).\n4. The car moves from x\u2081 to x\u2082 in 10 minutes, so the distance covered is x\u2081 - x\u2082 = h - h/\u221a3.\n5. Calculate the car\u2019s speed: speed = (h - h/\u221a3) / 10.\n6.
